#Let's combine the power of Dozens and VueJs

We use the decimal number system by virtue of the number of digist on our hands. 10 is only divisible exactly by 2 and 5 (besides itself and 1). 
Microprocessors represent data in a binary format, so all data types, whether characters, strings, integers or floats. are ultimately stored in 1s and 0s. Octal and hexadecimal are commonly used in programming and for representing colours.
In nature, geometry and timekeeping we need thirds more than fifths, so dozens, two-dozens and sixties are better suited to units such as degrees, months and hours.

Users may switching between binary, octal, decimal, duodecimal (dozenal, base 12), hexadecimal (base 16), vigesimal (base 20) or Sexagesimal (base 60)
